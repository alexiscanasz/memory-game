# Memory Game 📝

> A game made by Alexis Cañas.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.4.

## Initial steps

First, we must download the project's dependencies by executing the following command `npm i`

In the repository folder and in your preferred CLI run the command `ng serve` or `ng s` then, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/home`

If this is the first time you play, a modal window will appear asking for your name, after that you can start playing.

## ¿How to play?

The game consists of finding the two identical cards of each animal, when you guess right you will get a point in hits and when you fail you will get a point in errors, the game ends when you have found all the pairs of cards in the game.
